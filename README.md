# Introduction

Performing Opinion Mining On IMDB Movie Review Data Set.

In this analysis, we will analyse and predict the opinion or sentiment( positive/ negative) related to the movie review. We will analyse different machine learning models like Navie Bayes, Logistic regression, random forest and will evaluate their performance.

# Word Cloud

# Conclusion

We can observed that both logistic regression and multinomial naive bayes model performing well compared to random forest classifier.

Thus we can use any of the model suggested above to perdict the sentiment or opinion.

We can further improve the accuracy using deep learning models.

Still we can improve the accuracy of the models by preprocessing data and by using lexicon models like Textblob.
